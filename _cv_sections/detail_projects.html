Some relevant projects I have been involved during the last years:
<a class="link-badge" href="/projects/">[Check more details]</a>


<h3>At UMH (2022–present)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>TED2021</strong> (Oct 2025 – present): "Desarrollo de tecnologías móviles inteligentes para tareas de seguridad y vigilancia de entornos de interior y exterior".</li>
    <li><strong>ROBDEKON2:</strong> DFKI Bremen (Dec. 2025).</li>
    <li><strong>AViRobots</strong> (Jan 2025 – Oct 2025): "Development of an intelligent surveillance and security infrastructure system based on mobile robots".</li>
    <li><strong>PROMETEO</strong> (Nov 2022 – Dec 2024): "Towards Further Integration of Intelligent Robots in Society: Navigate, Recognize and Manipulate". Focused on achieving a better integration of mobile and intelligent robots into the current society. The project is aimed at three research lines: navigation, recognition and manipulation; with the idea of integrating the robotic solutions both in the natural environment and with the people involved on it.</li>
    <li><strong>ACTVIS (collaboration):</strong> Visión Activa: qué nos enseñan los movimientos oculares sobre las estrategias de búsqueda visual. Collaboration with Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (Dec 2024 – present).</li>
</ul>

<h3>At GMV (2017–2021)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>MOSAR</strong> (Mar 2019 – Oct 2021): "MOdular Spacecraft Assembly and Reconfiguration". Focused on orbital operations, this project focussed on the capabilities of in-orbit reconfiguration and servicing. A set of spacecraft modules and a walking manipulator was deployed to autonomously reconfigure capabilities, shape, power and data transfer between these spacecraft modules. H2020 SRC PERASPERA OG9. <a class="link-badge" href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/821996" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[link]</a></li>
    <li><strong>PROACT</strong> (Feb 2019 – Oct 2021): "Planetary RObots Deployed for Assembly and Construction Tasks". Focussed on collaboration in planetary robots, this project focussed on extending the autonomy capabilities of OG2 to a multi-agent system. Using this, a fleet of robots would autonomously make representative a set of operations to build an ISRU plant. H2020 SRC PERASPERA OG11. <a class="link-badge" href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/821903" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[link]</a></li>
    <li><strong>ADE</strong> (Feb 2019 – Oct 2021): "Autonomous DEcision making in very long traverses". Focused on planetary exploration robots, this project focused on enhancing the Autonomy framework with space hardware specifically targeting the accomplishments of long traverses in full autonomy. H2020 SRC PERASPERA OG10. <a class="link-badge" href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/821988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[link]</a></li>
    <li><strong>ERGO</strong> (Jan 2018 – Jan 2019): "European Robotic goal-oriented autonomous COntroller". Focused on delivering an advanced and flexible space autonomous framework with adaptable levels of autonomy. The framework includes mission planning, execution and monitoring along with path planning and trajectory control for both mobile robot base and robotic arms among other functionalities. H2020 SRC PERASPERA OG2. <a class="link-badge" href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/730086" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[link]</a></li>
    <li><strong>GOTCHA</strong> (Feb 2017 – May 2018): "GOAC TRL-increase Convenience-enhancements, Hardening and Application-extension". Aiming to develop a robotic autonomous controller for the space domain integrating an action-based planner. Its purpose is to enhance the autonomy capabilities on board space systems offering goal-based commanding and telemetry monitoring. ESA/GSTP. <a class="link-badge" href="https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/Shaping_the_Future/Autonomous_software_makes_planning_easy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[ESA post]</a></li>
