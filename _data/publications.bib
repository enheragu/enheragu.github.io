  abstract="Ensuring accurate assessment of the surrounding environment is crucial for the efficient operation of autonomous mobile robots, especially when faced with the complexities of unfamiliar and natural terrain that lacks a predefined structure. In this context, traversability assessment is presented as a fundamental component of the autonomous navigation. This research introduces a systematic methodology that employs a LiDAR sensor to capture detailed 3D point clouds, thus facilitating the analysis of traversability regions on both conventional roads and natural scenarios. The proposed approach integrates a well-structured sparse encoder-decoder configuration with rotation invariant features. This configuration is meticulously designed to replicate the input data by associating the acquired traversability features to each individual point in the 3D point cloud. Experimental results confirm the robustness and effectiveness of our method, especially in outdoor environments. Notably, our approach outperforms existing methodologies, making a significant contribution to the ongoing progress in the field of autonomous robotic navigation.",

  abstract="Exploring planets requires cooperative robotics technologies that make it possible to act independently of human influence. So-called multi-robot teams, consisting of different and synchronized robots, can solve problems that cannot be handled by a single robot. The PRO-ACT (PlanetaryPlanetary {\backslash}b RObots deployed for Assembly and Construction Tasks) project aimed to develop and demonstrate key technologies for robot collaboration in the construction of future ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization) facilities on the MoonMoon {\backslash}i. To this end, the following robots were used: Veles---a rover with six wheels and a 7-DoF (Degree of Freedom) arm, Mantis---a six-legged walkingWalking system, and a mobile gantry that can be used for payloadPayload {\backslash}i manipulation or 3D printing. The project further developed existing software and hardware developed in previous space robotics projects and integrated them into the robotic systems involved. The software enables collaborative tasks such as transportation, mapping and navigationNavigation {\backslash}b. Due to the Covid-19 situation, the final demonstration was performed remotely for defined mission scenarios. The intensive remote test campaigns provided valuable lessons learned that are directly applicable to future space missions. In addition, PRO-ACT opens a new way for multi-robot collaboration. The paper describes the developed robotic software and hardware as well as the final mission scenarios performed in lunar analogues with Mantis tested in the test field with granules in the DFKI Space Hall in Bremen, Germany, with Veles tested in Warsaw, Poland and with the mobile gantry tested in Elgoibar, Spain. In addition, one mission scenario, manipulation tasks with two robotic systems, was performed with two Panda robotic arms in Toulouse, France. The paper concludes with the results of the final demonstration of the multi-robotics team.",
